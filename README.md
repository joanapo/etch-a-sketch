# etch-a-sketch

This is the fourth project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). It let me practice concepts such as flexbox, DOM manipulation, for loops, if statements, functions, list iteration.

The game includes the below functionalities:
- User can modify the grid size by clicking "New Grid" \(sizes can be from 1x1 to 100x100\).
- User can click on "Color Mode" which randomizes the colors in the grid.
- User can click on "Opacity Mode" which makes each of the squares gain opacity which each new hover.
- User can click on "Clear Grid" to remove their sketch but retain the grid properties.
